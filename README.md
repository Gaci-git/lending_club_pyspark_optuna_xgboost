# Loan outcome prediction with XGBoost and Multi-Output HistGradientBoostingRegressor

Being able to accurately assess the risk of a loan application can save a lender the cost of holding too many risky assets.
Without having a credit score or credit history we will try to predict how profitable a loan will be compared to our loans database, accumulated over the years.

In this project, you'll find models that take some details from our customer's bio and credit info and predict loan outcome, loan grade, and a combination of loan subgrade and interest rate. A few features were engineered: how long it is taking to repay, and how long the customer has its credit account opened, that improved model accuracy. 

This projects goal: having an easy-to-interpret model that a loan officer can use to provide immediate estimates can not only speed up the process but also save lenders from potential losses.

You can find models deployed on Streamlit platform https://gaci-git-loan-club-streamlit-51xmir.streamlit.app
